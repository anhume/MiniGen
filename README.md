(BOB-11420)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11420)

The [MiniGen](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11420) designed to be used
either as a stand-alone board or as a shield that can be placed on top of an
Arduino Pro Mini. It's capable of generating sine, square or triangle waves at
up to 3MHz, and approximately 1Vp-p. The output is at a DC offset of Vcc/2.
Neither the offset nor the amplitude can be varied.

The MiniGen can be powered by any voltage from 2.3V to 5.5V, so it can be used
with either a 3.3V or 5V Pro Mini without any voltage regulation or signal level
shifting needed.
